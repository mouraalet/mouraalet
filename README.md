## Hello! I'm Letícia ツ

I have a degree in Industrial Engineering and a year ago I made a career switch to data analysis.

Studying independently, I created a self-taught learning journey based on a strategic planning methodology that I developed myself.

Today I work with data analysis using Power BI, Tableau and Google Data Studio. I also work with Social Listening dashboards, both building the panel and collecting data from various social networks, using Python.

Feel free to contact me and find out more about my studies and work!
